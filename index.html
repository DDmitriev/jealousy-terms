<p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with Jealousy mobile application (the "Service") operated by Jealousy ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our Jealousy mobile application (the "Service").</p>

<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Jealousy cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Jealousy customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Jealousy with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Jealousy to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Jealousy will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
<p><strong>Fee Changes</strong></p>
<p>Jealousy, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Jealousy will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
